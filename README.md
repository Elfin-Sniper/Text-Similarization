Text Similarization using Neural Networks

Project Description

This project focuses on text similarization using a neural network-based approach. The primary objective is to analyze and measure the similarity between different text inputs using deep learning techniques. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models, the system aims to provide accurate similarity scores, which can be used in various applications such as plagiarism detection, search ranking, and recommendation systems.

Features

Preprocessing of text data: Tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization.

Neural network-based similarity computation: Implementation of transformer-based or recurrent models.

Evaluation metrics: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and other relevant measures.

Dataset integration: Support for various text datasets for training and testing.

User interface (optional): A simple interface to test text similarity.
